This repository contains the class files used in our [Actionable Python book](https://www.amazon.com/Actionable-Python-Course-New-Python-Programmers/dp/1951959050).

## Book Description
Learning to program is hard. Don't let anyone tell you different. If you bought or are considering buying this book because someone told you that you should learn Python, then maybe you should reconsider. The big question to ask yourself is "Do you want to learn Python?" Certainly, this book will help you answer that question, but be prepared to struggle, and to make mistakes, and to get frustrated, and to bang your head against the keyboard. This is Pandora's box, baby, but...

If you get excited by solving hard problems... if you're into Sudoku, or crosswords, or jigsaw puzzles, or if you'll spend hours trying to figure out how to separate two metal looping thingamajigs that you found on someone's shelf..., or you like tinkering with engines, or figuring out the best recipe for chocolate chip cookies... in other words, if you like a challenge, then you might love Python programming.

It's not easy, but it's easy enough to get started. Pick up a book (good start!), and start going through it. Be patient with yourself. Pretend you're the teacher as well as the student. When the student fails, the good teacher doesn't insult or chastise. The good teacher encourages. The good teacher knows that failure is a part of learning, and that overcoming failure is exciting and leads to more learning. So, be a good teacher and treat yourself well.

But be a good student too. When reading this book, you should be sitting at your computer. When you first begin, plan to spend at least two uninterrupted hours. You should do your best to get through the first two lessons in the first sitting. That will get you through the foundational learning. From there on out, you'll be hopping back and forth between the book and viewing, editing, and writing code. Go through the book slowly and methodically. Read every demo carefully. Work through every exercise. You cannot learn to code through reading alone. You must practice.
